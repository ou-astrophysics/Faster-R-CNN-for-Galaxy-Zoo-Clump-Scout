# Faster-R-CNN-for-Galaxy-Zoo-Clump-Scout
Region Proposal Network using Zoobot finetunded for SDSS images from Galaxy Zoo: Clump Scout as backbone
## Backbone CNN
Finetune or train Zoobot from scratch, alternatively train EfficientNetB0 from scratch on SDSS images:
* Finetune Zoobot - `Finetune Zoobot to find Clumps.ipynb`
* Train Zoobot from scratch - `Train Zoobot to find Clumps.ipynb`
* Train EfficientNetB0 from scratch - `Train EfficientNet to find Clumps.ipynb`
## Work in progress...
